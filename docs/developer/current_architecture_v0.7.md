# Wenu current architecture v0.7

**Status:** Implemented baseline for the v0.8 migration
**Baseline commit:** `b72eef8`
**Date:** 2026-08-05

Wenu v0.7 implements independently selectable equatorial, ecliptic, and
Galactic coordinate-grid layers. It does not implement an observer-local
AltAz grid, although horizontal coordinates are already the canonical
spherical geometry used by projection and rendering. The horizon remains
chart-owned boundary geometry and is not optional reference content.

The canonical flow, ownership boundaries, declarative examples, render-local
detail policy, style ownership, and packaged-example parity documented by
`target_architecture_v0.7.md` remain in force.
